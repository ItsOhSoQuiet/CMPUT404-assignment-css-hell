Modifications to Project Gutenberg Books
=================

If there is ever a large block of inline CSS in a style tag in the head, like for The Count of Monte Cristo or The Book of Wonder, I removed it, replaced by my style.css file. 

I also removed the "width=60%" in divs containing images, as well as "width=100%" from images, in The Count of Monte Cristo, so that I could center the images.
